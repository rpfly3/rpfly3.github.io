## About

- Autonomous Vehicle/ADAS perception and localization algorithm design and implementation experience with techniques, such as Computer Vision, Deep Learning, SLAM, and Sensor Fusion. Hands-on experience with camera-based, LiDAR-based, and sensor-fusion based perception algorithm development with deep neural networks for 2D/3D object detection and tracking, and localization system development with SLAM.
- Real-time autonomous vehicle system development experience, and high-performance parallel computing algorithm design and implementation experience for highly scalable, fully distributed, multi-threaded cyber-physical systems. Hands-on development experience onembedded systems and distributed systems with OpenMPI and CUDA.
